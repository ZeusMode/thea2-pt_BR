      <Entry Key="QUEST_MQ_BABA2_DES" Val="You failed to undo the cmuch's curse, but the yaga mentioned something about the swamp's demons disappearing after the Shattering and a light appearing. Likely another case of the lightbringers' meddling."/>

      <Entry Key="QUEST_MQ_BANDITLAIR5_DES" Val="You sneak into the bandit camp and manage to rescue the scavenger child, along with a few others. They are unusually reluctant to be rescued, so they make a ruckus and you are forced to run fast before the bandits catch you. There's little chance of them being friendly now, but you can go back to the scavengers and report your success."/>
      <Entry Key="QUEST_MQ_BANDITLAIR6_DES" Val="The bandits sold you the scavenger child. Now you can go back to the scavengers and report your success."/>

      <Entry Key="QUEST_MQ_YAGA5_DES" Val="The witch was happy to learn of your success and wished you well. She and her hut moved away from this place."/>

      <Entry Key="QUEST_MQ_REDCAVE2_DES" Val="You entered deeper into the cave, but it holds more mysteries and you need aid to unravel them. You can choose to rescue an old dwarf from a prison - a tough but straightforward path. Or you can look for aid from other factions, such as the orcs, goblins, dwarves, or elves.
